Project Name
===================


## Setup and Remove

* Update project name in /README.md
* Update project name in /package.json
* Remove this section once completed


## Quick Start

* `npm install && grunt watch`


## Development Notes

A few quick reminders as your developing.

* When deleting .scss files make sure to run `grunt cleanup` or remove the /css/generated/ version of the deleted file
* Boilerplate uses the Underscore build of Lodash, so all [Lodash methods](http://lodash.com/docs) are available.

### Modernizr

Modernizr includes a very basic custom build, please update the file as tests are needed instead of loading the whole development version. This will limit the tests to only those actually needed for the project. Lets prevent running every Modernizr test on every page load of sites we develop. `</rant>`
